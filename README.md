# Trailblazer - React Native

## Description

This app was an idea that I had originally for Android but I never finished so I decided to try it in React Native.  The purpose is to be able to while hiking make points on you device to make it so you can return there.  For example if you wanted to keep track of where your car was or a spot where you want to meet some friends if you go away from each other.
